# LiminalWage
A 2021 game design student capstone project made in the 17X series at UC Santa Cruz

**Theme:**
You are an underpaid pizza delivery person runing around an infinite city made out of imposible geometry trying make as many deliveries as you can before your time - and morale - runs out. 
You can move infinitely in any direction through the procedurally generated city, and each individual street of the city wraps around on itself in physically imposible arrangements.
